Project Overview:

This project features an AI-powered voice assistant using advanced speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech technologies. It captures user voice inputs, processes them with a large language model, and delivers interactive voice responses via a Streamlit interface, enhancing user experiences across various applications.

Key Features:

	1.	Voice Recognition: Uses advanced speech recognition to capture and transcribe user voice inputs.
	2.	Natural Language Processing: Integrates a large language model to process the transcribed text and generate an appropriate response.
	3.	Text-to-Speech Conversion: Utilizes text-to-speech technology to convert the generated response back to speech, providing a seamless interactive experience.
	4.	Streamlit Integration: Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the voice assistant, including functionalities like playing the audio response and downloading the speech file.
	5.	Error Handling: Ensures robust error handling for both voice recognition and response generation to enhance user experience.

Potential Use Cases:

	•	Customer Support: Automate customer service inquiries with quick and accurate voice responses.
	•	Virtual Assistants: Enhance virtual assistants with natural voice interaction capabilities.
	•	Accessibility Tools: Provide voice-activated assistance for individuals with disabilities.
	•	Educational Tools: Develop interactive learning applications that respond to voice queries.
